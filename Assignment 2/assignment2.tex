\textbf{\large{Problem:}}
Savita and Hamida are friends.\\ What is the probability that both will have\\ (i) different birthdays?\\ (ii) the same birthday?\\ (ignoring a leap year). \hspace{0.6in}\((Prob,5.21)\)
\\\\\textbf{\large{Solution:}}
\\\indent
Let \(pr(A)\) be the probability that Savita and Hamida have their birthdays on a same day.
\\\indent Let \(pr(B)\) be the probability that Savita and Hamida have their birthdays on different days.
\\Savita's Birthday can be on any day of a non-leap year. Hamida's birthday can also be on any of the 365 days of the same year. We consider all of these 365 outcomes to be \textit{equally likely}.
\\\\
Considering Savita to have her birthday on a particular day,
for Hamida's and Savita's birthday to be different, there are \((365 - 1) = 364\) favourable outcomes.
\begin{align*}
    \therefore pr(B) &= \frac{364}{365}\\
    \therefore pr(B) &= 0.99726027 \hspace{1cm}....(i)
\end{align*}
\\Now, Savita and Hamida having their birthdays on the same day is the event that Savita and Hamida do not have birthdays on different days.
\begin{align*}
    \therefore pr(A) &= 1 - pr(B) \\
    \therefore pr(A) &= 1 - 0.99726027 \hspace{1cm}...(From(i))\\
    \therefore pr(A) &= 0.00273972
\end{align*}
\indent Hence, the probability that Hamida and Savita have their birthdays on the same day of the year is $0.00273972$ and on different days of the year is $0.99726027$.
